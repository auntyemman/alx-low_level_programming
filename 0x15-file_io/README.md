# C PROGRAMMING PROJECT FILE I/O
A file represents a sequence of bytes, regardless of it being a text file or a binary file. C programming language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on your storage devices. This chapter will take you through the important calls for file management.

In this project, I learned about the three standard file descriptors and there POSIX names as well as the difference between function and system calls. I practiced using the I/O system calls ~open~, ~~close~~, ~~~read~~~, and write and the flags O_RDONLY, WR_ONLY, and O_RDWR to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C. 0_RDWR is equal 2.
