# Singly linked lists in C
 Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand.

 Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

# Advantages over arrays
 1.Dynamic size
 2.Ease of insertion/deletion
# Linked List vs Array
 Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation.
